We painstakingly balanced its malt character against select Chinook, Centennial and Cascade hops to create a perfectly balanced, full-flavored beer. A lager yeast fermentation gives Colorado Native a slight fruitiness, complementing a citrus aroma note from a late kettle hop addition. Everything then comes together to deliver a clean taste and dry finish that is very drinkable by itself, or paired with your favorite foods.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"38","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":101,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GODLe0\/upload_nDg0Gu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GODLe0\/upload_nDg0Gu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GODLe0\/upload_nDg0Gu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:27:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":101,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Amber Lager","shortName":"American Amber Lager","description":"American-style amber lagers are light amber to amber or copper colored.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband.

We hand select only the choicest ingredients for each batch. The specialty grains and hops used by Bear Republic have been chosen for their unique characteristics. The recipes and their final formulations were developed over a period of several years. Those wonderful homebrewing sessions and the lessons learned from trial and error have established the solid foundations for each recipe's commercial equivalents. It's our goal to continually develop new recipes using our time tested home brewing methods. \"I feel home brewing is the laboratory where true advancement of beer styles is coming from. \"Richard G.
