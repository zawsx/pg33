His great grandparents were bootleggers in Detroit, running booze from Canada, who also ran a blind pig speakeasy out of their basement. Detroit police (including the Chief) were their main clientele. His great grandmother also made beer in her kitchen for the guys at the brickyard where she worked.\r\n\r\nNathan's grandfather Cecil -- rail worker, 17-year Ford employee turned weird angry recluse -- left Detroit for Hillsdale, MI to start farming. Cecil started brewing in the early 80's, naming beers after the things that inspired the recipes and included ingredients he grew or foraged. \r\n\r\nAfter some frustration with trying to break into brewing, Nathan started Bitter Old Fecker, working under Cecil as an apprentice. During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. \r\n\r\nNathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a \"rustic\" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown. His first brew, introduced in the Summer of 2013, is called Strutter, named after a nasty old rooster on Cecil's farm. Darlin', Kaplan, and Jet are brews that are soon to follow.","website":"http:\/\/drinkoldfecker.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:33:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:15","locations":[{"id":"SMLKXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12855 E Old US Hwy 12","locality":"Chelsea","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48118","phone":"(734) 444-5201","website":"drinkoldfecker.com","latitude":42.2986065,"longitude":-83.9821194,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","updateDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wYRw81","name":"Brewhouse Rarities Hoppy American Wheat Ale","nameDisplay":"Brewhouse Rarities Hoppy American Wheat Ale","description":"Tropical fruit and peach aromas and flavors dominate, followed by soft toasted biscuit malt notes.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"20","srmId":5,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wYRw81\/upload_4YQNic-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wYRw81\/upload_4YQNic-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wYRw81\/upload_4YQNic-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Give this beer a whirl with late-summer salads and fresh, fruity desserts.","createDate":"2014-11-10 20:12:45","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:28:37","srm":{"id":5,"name":"5","hex":"FBB123"},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Currently he is a big fan of Elysian and Russian River Brewing, and these companies have influenced his brewing style which he calls \u201caggressive California-style ales, with a Northwest twist, using fresh Northwest ingredients\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.barhopbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5efIdI\/upload_Vpv6M5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5efIdI\/upload_Vpv6M5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5efIdI\/upload_Vpv6M5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5efIdI\/upload_Vpv6M5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5efIdI\/upload_Vpv6M5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:16:11","locations":[{"id":"gOaK1T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 W.

It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"HizvxH","name":"Hopcat","nameShortDisplay":"Hopcat","description":"HopCat was envisioned, designed, stocked and staffed with one mission in mind: to bring you great beer.","website":"http:\/\/hopcatgr.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HizvxH\/upload_oqijUs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:56","locations":[{"id":"GANyEU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"25 Ionia Ave SW","locality":"Grand Rapids","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49503","phone":"616-451-4677","website":"http:\/\/hopcatgr.com\/","latitude":42.9623769,"longitude":-85.670585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"rtMecd","name":"HopCat Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"6280 N.
