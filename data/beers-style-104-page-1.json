Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The \u201cAdmiral\u201d Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.\r\n\r\nWe first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as \u201cShake Down Nut Brown\u201d. You can guess what went wrong from there\u2026 But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.","abv":"7","ibu":"23","glasswareId":5,"srmId":37,"availableId":4,"styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","year":2012,"labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_3Jl1St-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_3Jl1St-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_3Jl1St-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.071","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:35:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:47:43","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":37,"name":"37","hex":"3F0708"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","shortName":"Baltic Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:23","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"K8kj5d","name":"Alice Porter","nameDisplay":"Alice Porter","abv":"5.2","availableId":4,"styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K8kj5d\/upload_AXzgIY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K8kj5d\/upload_AXzgIY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K8kj5d\/upload_AXzgIY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-09 17:48:06","updateDate":"2015-12-18 00:43:17","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","shortName":"Baltic Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.","ibuMin":"35","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"9","srmMin":"40","srmMax":"40","ogMin":"1.072","fgMin":"1.016","fgMax":"1.022","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:41:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"Tfw5on","name":"Upland Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Upland","description":"We\u2019ve been brewing ales, lagers, and sours in Bloomington, Indiana since 1998.

It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans.

Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events.

For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co.
