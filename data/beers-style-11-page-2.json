I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I\u2019ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it\u2019s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!","website":"http:\/\/jackpinebrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_QgLu1t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_QgLu1t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_QgLu1t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_QgLu1t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3YeQjZ\/upload_QgLu1t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:52:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:50:13","locations":[{"id":"CPYUBy","name":"Jack Pine Brewery - Taproom","streetAddress":"7942 College Rd, Ste 115","locality":"Brainerd","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56425","phone":"(218) 270-8072","website":"http:\/\/jackpinebrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 4-7pm\r\nSaturday 4-7pm","latitude":46.3447626,"longitude":-94.2338287,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-16 22:54:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RTAvgW","name":"Earl of Brixom","nameDisplay":"Earl of Brixom","abv":"3.9","styleId":11,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-18 19:00:52","updateDate":"2015-12-18 19:00:52","style":{"id":11,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Dark Mild Ale","shortName":"English Dark Mild","description":"English dark mild ales range from deep copper to dark brown (often with a red tint) in color.

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met.
