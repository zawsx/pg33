Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:05","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

Originally settling in the Troy area they shortly moved to Dayton to establish their headquarters. Queen Matilda was well known for telling fortunes and had remarkable powers as a mesmerist, both qualities that were handed down to her as the eldest daughter in the Stanley family, and were secrets possessed by her alone. She was described as a \"plain, hardy-looking woman\u201d with a manner indicative of a strong and pronounced character. The Gypsy Queen, Matilda died in January 1878 after an illness of two years, and her body was embalmed so that it was said to \"retain the natural aspect of life.\" It was placed in the Woodland receiving vault in Dayton.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis chile beer is reddish-brown in color with copper highlights and has a mildly smoky finish with a medium body and caramel malt highlights. The hop character is very mild with just enough bitterness to balance the beer.

It was built to house The Farmington Drug Store and The Farmington Times-Hustler Newspaper (now The Daily Times), which became the longest standing drugstore and fountain in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe unique decor consists mostly of priceless items found in the building during the renovation. Three Rivers believes in preserving their historical heritage of downtown Farmington. The restaurant was expanded in July, 1999. The addition includes an outdoor private patio, a bar, and the largest beer label and beer coaster collections in New Mexico.

They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark.
