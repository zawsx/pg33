The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

Our specialty malts that provide the colour and flavour for some of our different beer styles are sourced from South Canterbury, Germany and the United Kingdom. We use the local town supply water, which is extremely good quality for our beer and cider production.\r\n\r\nOur beers and ciders are produced using all natural ingredients and are unpasteurised to retain their full flavour. We call it 'Real Live Beer' and encourage you to keep it well refrigerated to maintain quality and freshness.","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","mailingListUrl":"info@sprigandfern.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:19","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:14","locations":[{"id":"VWuTZv","name":"Tinakori Road Sprig & Fern Tavern","streetAddress":"342 Tinakori Rd","locality":"Thorndon","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"04 499 1390","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandferntaverns.co.nz\/taverns\/tinakori-road-wellington","latitude":-41.2788229,"longitude":174.7691029,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:20","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:01:49","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7QJgg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"53 Beach Road","locality":"Richmond","region":"Nelson","postalCode":"7020","phone":"03 544 8675","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n","latitude":-41.3337821,"longitude":173.1860035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 18:04:29","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:06:29","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pj0QFu","name":"Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Pilsner","description":"Pilsner is brewed as traditionally as possible and undoubtedly captures the essence of this historic beer style.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:44","locations":[{"id":"oz1oll","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"307 Oliphant Lane","locality":"Middletown","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02842","phone":"401-849-5232","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","latitude":41.5369904,"longitude":-71.2796012,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"W1B80w","name":"Pistola","nameDisplay":"Pistola","abv":"4.5","styleId":106,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 17:59:26","updateDate":"2015-04-28 13:28:22","style":{"id":106,"categoryId":10,"category":{"id":10,"name":"International Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"International-Style Pilsener","shortName":"International Pilsener","description":"International Pilseners are straw\/golden in color and are well attenuated.
