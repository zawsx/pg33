(Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","established":"1825","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jNvzFs\/upload_H7Odsu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:53:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:29:21","locations":[{"id":"8C6fp0","name":"Pivovarna La\u0161ko","streetAddress":"Trubarjeva ulica 28","locality":"La\u0161ko","postalCode":"`````","phone":"+386 3 734 80 00","website":"http:\/\/www.pivo-lasko.si\/","latitude":50.593349,"longitude":23.23594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"SI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-01 18:58:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"SI","name":"SLOVENIA","displayName":"Slovenia","isoThree":"SVN","numberCode":705,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GVq4dW","name":"Zomer Pils","nameDisplay":"Zomer Pils","description":"In summer, Belgians head to the nearest beach, while Texans typically race towards the nearest source of shade. That's because the European sun is far friendlier than the fiery ball glowing over the Lone Star State.\r\n\r\nCombat the heat with our Zomer Pils. Brewed with Belgian pilsner malt and noble hops, this traditional pilsner is light, crisp, and refreshing. So let that sun keep on burning.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"34","glasswareId":4,"srmId":3,"availableId":6,"styleId":106,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GVq4dW\/upload_tARwCV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GVq4dW\/upload_tARwCV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GVq4dW\/upload_tARwCV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Aged gouda, hot wings, Tex Mex, Chinese takeout","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2012-06-26 17:07:15","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:51:24","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":106,"categoryId":10,"category":{"id":10,"name":"International Styles","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"International-Style Pilsener","shortName":"International Pilsener","description":"International Pilseners are straw\/golden in color and are well attenuated. This medium-bodied beer is often brewed with rice, corn, wheat, or other grain or sugar adjuncts making up part of the mash. Hop bitterness is low to medium. Hop flavor and aroma are low. Residual malt sweetness is low--it does not predominate but may be perceived. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are acceptable. There should be no chill haze.","ibuMin":"17","ibuMax":"30","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.3","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:11"},"breweries":[{"id":"c7JVJR","name":"Lakewood Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lakewood","description":"From our origins home brewing out of a garage in the east Dallas neighborhood of Lakewood, to quickly becoming one of the fastest growing craft breweries in North Texas, we stay true to our vision of local beer for local folks.
