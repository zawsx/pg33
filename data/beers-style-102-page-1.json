While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

The most common approach used by the major breweries is a \u2018scientific one\u2019.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.

In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason\u2019s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked \u201chomebrews\u201d prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He\u2019s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason\u2019s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these \u201chomebrews\u201d. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA. Box Car Brewing Company became a reality.","website":"http:\/\/www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:53","locations":[{"id":"0k2SXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"306 Westtown Rd","locality":"West Chester","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19382","phone":"484-887-0538","website":"http:\/\/www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":39.9620632,"longitude":-75.5888196,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jcvu1F","name":"Brookside Lager","nameDisplay":"Brookside Lager","description":"A pale lager beer made without the darker malts that we use in Roslyn Beer.

By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality.

I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d.
