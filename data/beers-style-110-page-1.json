All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

This beer was fermented in two separate batches, one using a traditional American Ale yeast and the other using a Belgian Wit yeast. The two finished beers were then blended to create an extra layer of complexity and flavor. We also used two new hop varieties: Zythos & Calypso.

Barrette resolved that he would return to the area after wintering in Frenchtown.  It was possibly on this trip that he met Adolph Lozeau, another French-Canadian. Lozeau operated a ranch about five miles east of the mouth of Cedar. His Forty Mile House had been a wayfarer\u2019s stop along the Mullan Road for two years.\r\nIt was not until the next fall that Barrette finally returned to the basin that had caught his eye. He and his partner, Basil Lanthier, climbed into the steep, cedar-crowded gulch with several pack and saddle horses loaded with enough supplies to last them several weeks. Their departure from Frenchtown was not a secret, thus many eyes would be watchful for any indications that their trip was a success.\r\nAnd indeed, they did find gold, on October 9,1869, at the mouth of Cayuse Creek.\r\nOnce word got past Frenchtown, men (there were no women in Cedar this early) poured in from all over the territory, Northern Idaho, the surrounding states and even the West Coast. From Missoula one correspondent to the \u201cNew North-West\u201d wrote, \u201cMissoula has been wild for a week.\u201d The result, he said, was that \u201cHotel keepers, merchants, clerks, idle men and loafers, all are gone\u2026\u201d\r\nThis frantic mob rushing into such an isolated spot presented some very real problems in the way of lack of shelter and food shortages. Packers soon poured into the snow-packed drainage with beans (50 cents a pound), bacon (75 cents a pound) and gumboots ($18 a pair). Housing was of the roughest sort-canvas shelters and brush hovels. The territory\u2019s papers warned the determined stampeders to go \u201cwell clad, blanketed and pursed.\u201d\r\nThe Beer:\r\nTaking beer back to the era of the 1850\u2019s California Gold Rush, the Cayuse Creek Common brings the flavor. The rustic wood aromas (reminiscent of the barn wood in the taproom) of Northern Brewer hops take charge of the nose, while a slight caramel whiff lingers in the background. The rich copper color hints at the flavors of caramel and grains that collaborate with Northern Brewer hop profile. The finish is distinctly crisp and dry.","abv":"4","ibu":"30","styleId":110,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Ips06a\/upload_CwkRUx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Ips06a\/upload_CwkRUx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Ips06a\/upload_CwkRUx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Italian dishes, salsas, salads, chicken dishes, grilled foods, fish, shellfish and spicy foods\r\nThe Cheese Pairing:\r\nEnglish Cheddar (mild to sharp), Ermesenda","createDate":"2015-11-05 04:46:15","updateDate":"2015-12-18 06:14:13","style":{"id":110,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"California Common Beer","shortName":"California Common","description":"California Common Beer is light amber to amber in color and is medium bodied.

Similar to a farmer\u2019s table, our beer selections change with the seasons. By brewing in small batches, we can ensure that a few old favorites are always on tap, but new goodies greet visitors each month.\r\n\r\nOur brewery is founded on passion for high quality, flavorfully crafted beer and the belief that the best pints are those shared with good company. Drawing inspiration from beer gardens of Bavaria, we designed Denver Beer Co. to be a place where new and old friends can share a table and pint out of doors.","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vuehNG\/upload_uWikw4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:28","locations":[{"id":"anUUVa","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1695 Platte St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80202","phone":"1-303-433-2739","website":"http:\/\/denverbeerco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":39.758265,"longitude":-105.007315,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:49:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4VHsHN","name":"Common","nameDisplay":"Common","abv":"5.2","styleId":110,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-11 18:33:45","updateDate":"2015-03-11 18:34:44","style":{"id":110,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"California Common Beer","shortName":"California Common","description":"California Common Beer is light amber to amber in color and is medium bodied.

The results were award-winning products with a reputation for craft excellence.\r\n\r\nGREAT BEER FROM WINE COUNTRY\r\nAs one of Temecula\u2019s first craft breweries, Black Market introduced locally brewed beers to the community. Now found far beyond Temecula, Black Market beers are on shelves and in establishments throughout Southern California, Arizona and Washington.\r\n\r\nLEADING A MOVEMENT\r\nLike many craft breweries before us, we have followed stories of those who came before us.
