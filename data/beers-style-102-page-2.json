It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbr\u00e4uhaus beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeuhaus.de\/","established":"1589","mailingListUrl":"info@hofbrauhaus.us","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-17 14:36:33","locations":[{"id":"BzJnwS","name":"Hofbr\u00e4uhaus M\u00fcnchen","streetAddress":"Am Platzl 9","locality":"M\u00fcnchen","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)89-\/-92105-0","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeuhaus.de\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily 9:00am -

The M\u00e4rzen\/Oktoberfest style beer which is served during the celebration is often brewed in the spring and held cold over the summer to be tapped in spectacular fashion at the beginning of Oktoberfest in Munich.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs.

We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:48:26","locations":[{"id":"UnpaXM","name":"The Tasting Room at Hoppin' Frog","streetAddress":"1680-F East Waterloo Rd.","locality":"Akron","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44306","phone":"234-525-3764","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","latitude":41.0245928,"longitude":-81.4677107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-08-18 14:10:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
