The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.

A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts\u2019 business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.\r\n\r\n ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE\r\n\r\nWe are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma. All hop varieties are carefully selected to suit their particular type of brew.","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-02 16:10:22","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:51","locations":[{"id":"uPcCls","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Sollefte\u00e5","postalCode":"881 00","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-26 14:33:51","updateDate":"2014-12-26 14:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bwmm73","name":"Daytona Dark Wheat Lager (Batch No. 32218)","nameDisplay":"Daytona Dark Wheat Lager (Batch No. 32218)","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":103,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/bwmm73\/upload_IOvFAc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/bwmm73\/upload_IOvFAc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/bwmm73\/upload_IOvFAc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-15 12:57:42","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:25:14","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":103,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Dark Lager","shortName":"American Dark Lager","description":"This beer's malt aroma and flavor are low but notable.

However, with its flavorful products the company has quickly won innumerable friends outside \u00c5land, and Stallhagen beer is now sold in both Finland and Sweden. Steadily increasing demand and investments in higher production capacity have led to a growth in sales volumes and made the Stallhagen brand well-known to beer-lovers generally, not just the growing flock of experts and connoisseurs.","website":"http:\/\/www.stallhagen.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FrIEDm\/upload_TpB4HJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-22 21:58:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:46","locations":[{"id":"SffK5k","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Getav\u00e4gen 196","region":"Godby","postalCode":"22410","latitude":60.2299259,"longitude":19.9879698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"FI","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","updateDate":"2015-09-30 15:12:07","country":{"isoCode":"FI","name":"FINLAND","displayName":"Finland","isoThree":"FIN","numberCode":246,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4gmAzB","name":"Devil's Pride Black Lager","nameDisplay":"Devil's Pride Black Lager","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":103,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-02 23:07:42","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:51","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":103,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Dark Lager","shortName":"American Dark Lager","description":"This beer's malt aroma and flavor are low but notable.

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter\u2019s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret\u2019s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter\u2019s passion \u2013 brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He\u2019s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country\u2019s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret\u2019s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition \u2013 the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation\u2019s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing \u2013 perhaps one of the world\u2019s smallest craft brewers \u2013 brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.worthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/5hWjSw\/upload_Kupy28-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:17","locations":[{"id":"Z5oRX9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"826 Central Ave","locality":"Northwood","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50459","phone":"641-324-4991","website":"http:\/\/www.worthbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room Hours: \r\nWed: 5 to 9 p.m.\r\nFri: 5 to 11 p.m.\r\nSat: noon to 11 p.m.","latitude":43.444055,"longitude":-93.220486,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
