The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!\r\n\r\nSome would say our legendary steak sandwiches and two dozen rotating taps are a match made in heaven.

In the day, if you ordered an 'ale' in a British pub you got pale ale. It was preferred by the upper classes over porters, which were a distinctly working-class style. Pale ale, as well as lighter beers in general, are notoriously difficult to get 'just right' because the lighter body will show off any issues with flavors or balance.\r\n\r\nLike the musical scale, Pentatonic Pale is brewed with just five grains; wheat, oats, rye, pale malt barley, and crystal malt barley. This gives the beer a pleasant initial rye twang, followed by a very smooth character, topped by lots of dry hops, which add lots of hop aroma without adding bitterness.","abv":"4.5","ibu":"40","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":10,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-08 11:21:06","updateDate":"2012-09-08 11:21:06","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":10,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Pale Mild Ale","shortName":"English Pale Mild","description":"English pale mild ales range from golden to amber in color.

Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Triangle beers are not pasteurized nor do we add preservatives (except for a healthy addition of hops). Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Triangle beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, soon one will be able to walk into any fine restaurant and pub in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill region and be pretty sure of finding a Triangle beer available.","website":"http:\/\/www.trianglebrewery.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:18","locations":[{"id":"OblNj8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"918 Pearl Street","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-683-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.trianglebrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tours every Saturday 1pm to 2:30pm","latitude":35.996523,"longitude":-78.889416,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gXseoA","name":"Saboteur","nameDisplay":"Saboteur","description":"Our brewer\u2019s created an unpretentious, yet sophisticated brown ale.
