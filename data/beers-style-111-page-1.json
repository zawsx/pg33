Koji mold is a change agent, ie Koji will break down the starch molecules {long chains} into small chains of molecules and eventually into sugar. The sake yeast will then take over and convert those rice sugars into alcohol and CO2. Typically, only a tiny portion of the steamed rice is incolulated with Koji mold. The Koji mold will then start its \u201cmagic\u201d. A yeast starter {\u201cmoto\u201d} follows next {combination of steamed rice, water, koji mold, and yeast}. The \u201cmoto\u201d is then transferred to a larger vat where the same mix of water, steamed rice, and koji will be added {typically} three more times over the next four days {this fermenting mixture is called \u201cmoromi\u201d } Now here comes the difference to an ALL KOJI Sake: The entire steamed rice {not only a tiny fraction of it} will be inoculated with koji. This will lead to a much higher intensity and speed of starch break down {higher degree of aminoc acid and lactic acid} . In addition, many more sugar molecules will be available for the \u201cyeast attack\u201d","abv":"16","styleId":111,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-08 18:52:03","updateDate":"2015-04-17 17:36:50","style":{"id":111,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Ginjo Beer or Sake-Yeast Beer","shortName":"Gingo\/Sake","description":"A beer brewed with Sake yeast or Sake (koji) enzymes.

His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:49:44","locations":[{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1257 Kounosu","locality":"Naka-shi","region":"Ibaraki","phone":"+81 (0)29-298-0105","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","latitude":36.46801,"longitude":140.475563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7nFUlm","name":"Mista Sparkle","nameDisplay":"Mista Sparkle","description":"Mista Sparkle is a Japanese inspired ale brewed with a mixture of white and brown rice, Japanese grown Sorachi Ace hops, Jasmine green tea and fermented with Sake yeast.
