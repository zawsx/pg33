Owner\/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","website":"http:\/\/www.rushriverbeer.com","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:30","locations":[{"id":"hHD54O","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"990 Antler Court","locality":"River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54022","phone":"1-715-426-2054","latitude":44.8902357,"longitude":-92.6377675,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"k70sIR","name":"Smiling Lizard Shandy","nameDisplay":"Smiling Lizard Shandy","abv":"4.2","glasswareId":5,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/k70sIR\/upload_nVfdUc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:14","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:41:56","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:57","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0Wbj8j","name":"Spinner","nameDisplay":"Spinner","abv":"4.5","ibu":"50","availableId":4,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0Wbj8j\/upload_HJGWg5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0Wbj8j\/upload_HJGWg5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0Wbj8j\/upload_HJGWg5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Grilled Steak, Pad Thai, Brie.","createDate":"2015-12-11 19:11:12","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:41:11","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

The brewery, which occupies 9,000 square feet at 429 W. 3rd St in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was founded by Mike Hiller in July 2007.  Though a native of South Williamsport, Barbarian Chief, Mike Hiller, first entered the craft brewing industry in 1997 as an Account Services Associate for Legendary Distributors, Ltd., of Richmond, Virginia. After nearly a year of distributing beer, an opportunity arose for Mike to work as a brewer for Legend Brewing Company. Mike worked with five other brewers to perform duties at all levels of production including brewing, cellar work, cleaning and maintenance.  After nearly four years of service at Legend Brewing Company, Mike moved to Boston, MA, so his wife, Kira, could attend grad school. Tired of listening to him whine about how much he missed brewing, Kira gave him a home brewing kit as an anniversary gift. Mike began brewing whenever he could find the time. He developed the recipes for Hammerin' Ale, Headbangerz Brown Ale, Square Feet Wheat, Weldspatter I.P.A. and several other beers in five-gallon batches on his apartment's balcony.  Mike was also commissioned by friends and co-workers to brew beer for special occasions.  In fact, Square Feet Wheat was actually first brewed for an art gallery opening featuring works by the Barbarian's logo and label designer, Erick Thomas.  After reading Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship by Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head Brewery fame, Mike was inspired to start his own brewery. He spent eight months researching and writing a business plan. Another year was spent gathering support and revising his business plans. Thanks to the support of family, friends and other area businessmen who believed in Mike's dream, Bavarian Barbarian Brewing Company is now a reality.","website":"http:\/\/www.bavarianbarbarian.com","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:18","locations":[{"id":"bcXmR6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"429 W. 3rd St","locality":"Williamsport","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17701","phone":"570.332.5050","website":"http:\/\/www.bavarianbarbarian.com","latitude":41.238187,"longitude":-77.009056,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:21:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"g5yMlT","name":"St-Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale","nameDisplay":"St-Ambroise Apricot Wheat Ale","description":"Apricot Wheat Ale blends various barley malts with malted wheat and natural apricot essence to create an original-tasting beer with a clean, fruit nose.\n\n5% alc\/vol  Available in Bottles and Draft","abv":"5","styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g5yMlT\/upload_P6oYqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g5yMlT\/upload_P6oYqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g5yMlT\/upload_P6oYqa-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:16","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:17:09","style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot.

Then, our brewmasters mix in fresh lemonade and citrus flavors to create an adventurous taste that's perfect for those lazy days of summer.","abv":"4.2","ibu":"13.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":6,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/nJjPsG\/upload_krLx70-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/nJjPsG\/upload_krLx70-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/nJjPsG\/upload_krLx70-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The refreshing lemonade flavor of Summer Shandy goes great with backyard dishes like BBQ chicken, hot dogs, brats and Italian sausages.","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:36","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:27:00","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to \u201cimplied ingredients\u201d that weren\u2019t actually present in the beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.roosterfishbrewing.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:39","locations":[{"id":"TxaTZN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 - 301 North Franklin Street","locality":"Watkins Glen","region":"New York","postalCode":"14891","phone":"607-535-9797","website":"http:\/\/www.roosterfishbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am","latitude":42.381121,"longitude":-76.874257,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"yS64Yy","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Th\u00fcringen","latitude":50.9307183,"longitude":12.0076316,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:22","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MQjgRs","name":"Summer Sunrise","nameDisplay":"Summer Sunrise","glasswareId":4,"availableId":6,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQjgRs\/upload_yFLq08-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQjgRs\/upload_yFLq08-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQjgRs\/upload_yFLq08-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:19","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:50:07","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"dKS4wa","name":"Hometown Cellars Winery & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Hometown Cellars Winery","description":"Hometown Cellars, located in the heart of Michigan's lower peninsula, offers a variety of quality wines and beers for you to sample and choose from.
