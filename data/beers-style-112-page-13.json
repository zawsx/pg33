It seems only fitting that beer is being brewed in this quaint little two-story brick structure built in the 1920's. It's had its history as the jail, fire station, courthouse, mason lodge, and last but not least a sandwich shop that made those little sandwiches you can buy in gas stations. You know the triangle packaged ones that have mystery meat in them? Don't lie, you've had one. Today it is home to JailHouse Brewing Company and we are brewing hand-crafted beer not punching out license plates.","website":"http:\/\/www.jailhousebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0plKDH\/upload_wwlO0i-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0plKDH\/upload_wwlO0i-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0plKDH\/upload_wwlO0i-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0plKDH\/upload_wwlO0i-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0plKDH\/upload_wwlO0i-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:08:11","locations":[{"id":"JvvUYl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8 Cherry Street","locality":"Hampton","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30228","phone":"678-734-3202","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday's 2-6pm","latitude":33.386539,"longitude":-84.282384,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DxPqFm","name":"Summer Wheat","nameDisplay":"Summer Wheat","availableId":4,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-18 18:04:06","updateDate":"2014-09-18 18:04:06","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:40","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Hd1X4K","name":"Sutter Wheat","nameDisplay":"Sutter Wheat","description":"Unique in its German style, but a subtle Belgian influence.  an American variation to a traditional beer.","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:20","updateDate":"2015-06-18 18:40:14","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:57","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bnjyY1","name":"The Relentless","nameDisplay":"The Relentless","description":"Strong spicy rye nose, dry hoppy bitterness throughout, smooth slightly bitter finish, lingering rye spice notes.","abv":"6.7","glasswareId":5,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The bitter spiciness of this beer pairs great with grilled fare, burgers, vegetables, and fresh produce.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States.
