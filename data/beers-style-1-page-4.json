That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:07","locations":[{"id":"qjZIZq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HEPtEl","name":"No. 14 English Style Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"No. 14 English Style Pale Ale","description":"pale copper-colored traditional english-style ale has a gentle floral and fruit aroma; bitterness that is pleasant but pronounced balancing the caramel, malty base; and a variety hop flavors: woody, herbal, floral, and fruit notes; medium body","abv":"5.6","ibu":"45","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.056","createDate":"2015-01-16 15:57:13","updateDate":"2015-01-16 15:57:13","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:11:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:53:28","locations":[{"id":"Zhydrx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2545 Progress Street","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 295-0217","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","latitude":33.148172,"longitude":-117.218047,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:13:42","updateDate":"2015-08-26 16:23:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HG5V1w","name":"Pale","nameDisplay":"Pale","description":"Available in:\r\n330ml Bottle, 50L Keg, 40L Cask","abv":"4.5","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/HG5V1w\/upload_UOfYPr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/HG5V1w\/upload_UOfYPr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/HG5V1w\/upload_UOfYPr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-09 12:39:49","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:19:55","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2016-05-07 18:30:52","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JnWsDe","name":"Pale Ale, Chinook Columbus","nameDisplay":"Pale Ale, Chinook Columbus","abv":"5","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JnWsDe\/upload_bGxLrs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-23 18:35:05","updateDate":"2015-12-17 19:54:28","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore.

To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore.

To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:24","locations":[{"id":"SY2b6E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","latitude":43.18111,"longitude":-90.072391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Qa4Nst","name":"Prospector Pale","nameDisplay":"Prospector Pale","description":"A classic English pale brewed with North American and British malts with a  distinctive hop flavor that is memorable and delicious.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"34","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Qa4Nst\/upload_QWYOxp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Qa4Nst\/upload_QWYOxp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Qa4Nst\/upload_QWYOxp-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-05 22:08:18","updateDate":"2016-01-06 14:56:49","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:13","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
