Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Shannon Irish Cream Ale is brewed to have a subtle malt start and the rich character associated with the finest Irish pale ales. It is fermented with ale yeast at a low temperature, causing the yeast to halt fermentation just before full attenuation. The beer is allowed to settle for a few days before we start a secondary fermentation with a lager yeast. This combination of yeast and fermentation temperatures gives Shannon Irish Cream Ale a complex start with wonderful fruit aromas reminiscent of apricot and pears. It also provides the drinker a crisp and dry finish.
