That is why we aim to bring a line of clean easy-drinking English inspired ales that everyone can enjoy to the Triangle area in late 2013. \r\n\r\nWe love beer with extreme flavors or high alcohol content as much as the next guy, but that's not for everyone, which is why we will be producing extremely balanced and flavorful beers at a lower alcohol level that will be easily approachable and everyone will be able to find a beer that they enjoy in our lineup.\r\n\r\nFortnight Brewing is a true partnership of local and English flavors. The company's ownership consists of both English citizens and North Carolina natives, and our beers will utilize premium English malts and hops as well as locally-grown ingredients. \r\n\r\nFortnight Brewing will be located in Cary NC with plans of opening in Summer or Fall of 2013.

In West Waterford, the hard water profile means flavours of the English bitter style can be replicated. Coupled with this, the beer is hopped solely with Challenger hops, an English hop used in many traditional bitters.

We always start with the best quality ingredients including; Maris Otter malt, full leaf hop cones and the limestone rich water of West Waterford.\r\nOur brewer strives for quality and consistency across every stage of the brew, working hard to ensure that each bottle achieves the high standards he has set. All the beers are craft brewed in small batches and by its artisan nature this can lead to slight variations by batch.\r\nThe brewhouse is a 6bbl plant made by PBC Brewery Installations, the UK\u2019s top micro brewery installer and is ideally suited to the bottle-conditioned traditional ales that we brew.\r\nBottling is currently done by hand with a four-head filler with plans to upgrade this to an automated system in the coming months.","website":"http:\/\/dungarvanbrewingcompany.com","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vFrJjr\/upload_AttiC8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-16 01:08:24","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:54:43","locations":[{"id":"aps8aW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 5 No. 2","extendedAddress":"Westgate Business Park","region":"Waterford","phone":"+353 58 24000","website":"http:\/\/www.dungarvanbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":52.0955413,"longitude":-7.633504,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-16 13:00:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"V9yRXX","name":"Continental Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Continental Pale Ale","description":"Our take on an English style Pale Ale.
