Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity.

He chose the site of an ancient monastery, St Francis Abbey in Kilkenny City, to position his brewery. John was inspired by a tradition of brewing on this site, the foundations of which were laid four centuries earlier. Back in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well, on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis' Well. To this day the Abbey stands proudly at the heart of the brewery and continues to inspire our brewers.","website":"http:\/\/www.smithwicks.ie\/","established":"1710","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:57","locations":[{"id":"FRXKiy","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Kilkenny Co.","region":"Kilkenny","phone":"+353 (0)56 779 64 98","latitude":52.651194,"longitude":-7.251514,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1710","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sRgYvl","name":"Snow Plowed Winter Ale","nameDisplay":"Snow Plowed Winter Ale","description":"Snow Plowed Winter Ale is a full bodied brown colored ale with a distinct maltiness and an earthy hop balance.

Beers were brewed on Sunday mornings, where biscuity malt and hop aromas would waft through their house waking up their two other housemates. Before too long they realised they wanted to brew these beers every day of the week and share their passion of brewing and drinking good beer with the rest of London.\r\n\r\nRecipes were put together, brewing vessels were purchased, an industrial premises was let and the brewery in Summerstown, London, was born. Alex Bull and Chris Mills, the co-founders, had put together a microbrewery based in South-West London which created small-batch full-flavoured ales. Initially, four flagship ales were brewed for cask ale and bottles, with new on-off limited edition beers being created every month.\r\n\r\nWithin 18 months of operation the brewery was expanded with new vessels installed and a Brewery Tap was added. The expansion enabled keg beers to be produced, including a variety of lagers and stronger craft keg beers, with our Brewery Tap serving our beers directly from where they are brewed.\u00ad\r\nWe now produce four flagship ales and at least three varying seasonal ales every month. We also produce five flagship bottle beers which are sold to many of London\u2019s finest beer bottle shops and also have two flagship keg beer(our Crafty Lager 5.3% & Wolfie Smith Amber Ale 5.2%) with four seasonal kegs beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bythehorns.co.uk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13 22:12:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:02:16","locations":[{"id":"yN5FBR","name":"By The Horns Brewing Co","streetAddress":"25 Summerstown, Wandsworth","extendedAddress":"London","locality":"London","postalCode":"SW17 0BQ","phone":"+44 203 417 7338","website":"http:\/\/www.bythehorns.co.uk\/","latitude":51.4325056,"longitude":-0.1847287,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13 22:13:50","updateDate":"2014-12-23 12:31:07","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MnrOe5","name":"Stingo","nameDisplay":"Stingo","abv":"4.2","styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-21 17:34:32","updateDate":"2012-12-21 17:34:33","style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character.

Gold is in the colours and culture of this place, the campfires and the ever-lasting summer sun.","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":1,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Cuisine: Pan Asian; Cheese: earthy,  Camembert, Fontina, nutty, Asiago, Colby, Parmesan, tangy, Brick, Edam, Feta; General: Salad; Meat: Poultry","createDate":"2014-01-25 01:48:22","updateDate":"2015-10-27 18:46:25","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":1,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Classic English-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"English Pale","description":"Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character. Note that \"earthy, herbal English-variety hop character\" is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:18:23"},"breweries":[{"id":"UYYqri","name":"Yukon Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Yukon","description":"Yukon Brewing opened its doors in 1997 under the name Chilkoot Brewing Co. Ltd. Owners Alan and Bob conceived their idea like many Yukon babies \u2013 around a campfire on a canoe trip. Both Ontario natives, they\u2019ve lived and worked in the Territory for a good deal of their adult lives.\r\n\r\nFrom that inaugural conversation grew plans for a craft brewery that would service the north with quality beer while keeping jobs and money in the territory.\r\n\r\nOver a decade later Yukon Brewing, as it is called today, continues to work towards that goal. Employing a dozen or so staff (more in the busy summer months), Yukon Brewing actively supports countless Yukon events and causes each year.\r\n\r\nBob and Alan continue as owners and chief operators, growing the company outside the Yukon. The breweries 8 packaged beers are available across Alberta and BC with some even finding their way as far east as Quebec and at the Hannover Zoo in Germany.","website":"http:\/\/yukonbeer.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_7DayG4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_7DayG4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_7DayG4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_7DayG4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UYYqri\/upload_7DayG4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:16:30","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:30:31","locations":[{"id":"catP9J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"102 Copper Road","locality":"Whitehorse","region":"Yukon","postalCode":"Y1A 2Z6","phone":"867-668-4183","website":"http:\/\/yukonbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"OPEN 7 DAYS A WEEK\r\n11am to 6pm\r\nTours Everyday at 12, 2 & 4\r\nCall ahead to reserve your spot!","latitude":60.737891,"longitude":-135.079566,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:43:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
