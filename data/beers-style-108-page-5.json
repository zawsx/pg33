We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Will Shelton took his idea for a novel German-style ale to Paper City Brewery in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and Beer of the Gods was born, to extraordinary commercial success, critical acclaim, and unabashed adoration from beer geeks the world over.\r\n\r\nEventually, Will discovered that he enjoyed selling the beer he made even more than he did the splendid beers that Shelton Brothers imports, and in June 2008, he abandoned his brother to focus on making American beer that added an American attitude to the best of European beer styles. The beer is still lovingly made at Paper City, but look for High & Mighty to open a brewery of its own in 2010.","website":"http:\/\/www.highandmightybeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s6FkDL\/upload_9UPSsD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s6FkDL\/upload_9UPSsD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s6FkDL\/upload_9UPSsD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s6FkDL\/upload_9UPSsD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s6FkDL\/upload_9UPSsD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:09:36","locations":[{"id":"pX8lES","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"108 Cabot Street","locality":"Holyoke","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01040","phone":"413-323-8040","website":"http:\/\/www.highandmightybeer.com\/","latitude":42.2011759,"longitude":-72.610427,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"ETtkIW","name":"Bluejacket","nameShortDisplay":"Bluejacket","description":"Brewery and Tavern in SE Washington, DC.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluejacketdc.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/neighborhoodrestaurantgroup.us2.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=d879a39f766b935628a8d1295&id=eb7332cb6d","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ETtkIW\/upload_ipdw4w-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-16 16:09:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:33","locations":[{"id":"YhxPMZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"300 Tingey St SE","locality":"Washington","region":"District of Columbia","postalCode":"20003","phone":"(202) 524-4862","website":"http:\/\/www.bluejacketdc.com\/","latitude":38.875171,"longitude":-77.001023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-16 16:10:07","updateDate":"2015-03-03 17:28:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xQ8PM8","name":"The Publican","nameDisplay":"The Publican","description":"The Publican is a hoppy ale that is highly aromatic and finishes crisp and dry.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:13","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8zg27A","name":"Tuff Session Ale","nameDisplay":"Tuff Session Ale","description":"Pale ale \u2022 Bright, copper colour \u2022 Toasty malt palate \u2022 Pacific northwest hops \u2022 Medium body \u2022 Clean, dry finish \u2022 A sessionable ale from tuff city","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":108,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8zg27A\/upload_c8fEs5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8zg27A\/upload_c8fEs5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8zg27A\/upload_c8fEs5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 20:36:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:59:07","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":108,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Session Beer","shortName":"Session","description":"Any style of beer can be made lower in strength than described in the classic style guidelines.
